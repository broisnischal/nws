							Hi, I'm Nischal Dahal, a web designerðŸš€developer focused on
							crafting great web experiences. I am a self taught developer, FOSS
							lover, linux enthusiast. I have always loved creating something
							out of nothing. When I was little I started with photography,
							moved on to digital marketing, and then I found the digital world
							where it was possible to create anything! I started creating
							anything and everything; games, 2D Animation, softwares and
							websites. Now I like building new stuff and work with other people
							â€“ nothing really interesting is ever built alone!
